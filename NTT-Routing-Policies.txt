BGP IPv4 peer filter policy
The following is the NTT Communications filtering policy with its peers:
Inbound
NTT Communications accepts only those prefixes of length /24 and shorter from traditional class A, B, and C space.
NTT Communications uses max-prefix filters at most public exchanges. The max-prefix filter is set to 110% of the greater of the following values:
number of prefixes announced in the last 24 hours
number of prefixes registered in the routing registries under the peer's as-set if this number is less than 5000.
Outbound
NTT Communications will accept any properly registered prefix from our customers but will announce only /24 and shorter prefixes to our peers.
All NTT Communications announcements are registered in one of the routing registries and included under as-set AS2914:AS-GLOBAL.
NTT Communications reserves the right to modify this policy without prior notice.
BGP IPv6 peer filter policy
The Internet community filters IPV6 announcements based on the IPV6 allocations from ARIN. The allocations (and filtering) are necessary in order to minimize routing table expansion. Any customer requiring BGP multi-homing, now or in the future, should apply for Provider Independent (PI) IPv6 space directly from ARIN. ARIN can also allocate /48 critical infrastructure space if justified (eg. root domain operators). Customers with multiple connections to the NTT network may announce longer prefixes along with their ARIN allocation to effectively manage their inbound traffic, but longer prefixes than /48 will not be propagated beyond the AS2914 backbone. 

More information regarding ARIN's IPv6 assignment and allocation policies can be found here: http://www.arin.net/policy/nrpm.html#six 

The following is the NTT Communications filtering policy with its peers:
Inbound
NTT Communications will accept /48 and shorter prefixes from our peers.
Outbound
NTT Communications will announce /48 and shorter prefixes to our peers.
NTT Communications reserves the right to modify this policy without prior notice.
NTT Communications Global IP Network Routing Registry
The NTT Communications Global IP Network requires all customers using BGP to register each route that will be advertised in either:

the NTT Communications Global IP Network routing registry, or
one of the Internet routing registries mirrored by in the NTT Communications Global IP Network routing registry
the ARIN WHOIS registry using the OriginAS attribute
the NIC.br public whois registry at registro.br
the global RPKI using an RPKI ROA
The current list of mirrored registries is:
AfriNIC
ALTDB
APNIC
ARIN IRR
ARIN WHOIS
BBOI
BELL
JPIRR
LEVEL3
RADB
REGISTROBR
RGNET
RIPE
RIPE-NONAUTH
RPKI
TC
NTT Communications Global IP Network customers are welcome to register their routes in the NTT Communications Global IP Network routing registry. Look here for more information on this registry.

Note: Please make sure all of your Route Objects (ROs) are registered under your ASN or AS-SET. In addition, we do not recommend relying on proxy ROs. Just as they are automatically created, they can be automatically deleted.
Route Dampening
The NTT Global IP Network does not use route dampening.

BCP 214 / RFC 8327 BGP Session Culling Compliance
The NTT Global IP Network is compliant with BCP 214 / RFC 8327, specifically section 3.1 "Voluntary BGP Session Teardown Recommendations".

Before NTT GIN commences activities that can cause disruption to flow of data through Internet circuits, NTT GIN will - whenever possible - reduce loss of traffic by issuing an administrative shutdown to all BGP sessions running across the circuit and wait a few minutes for data-plane traffic to subside.

While architectures exist to facilitate quick network reconvergence (such as BGP Prefix Independent Convergence (BGP PIC), NTT GIN cannot assume the remote side has such capabilities. As such, a grace period between the Administrative Shutdown and the impacting maintenance activities is warranted.

After the maintenance activities have concluded, NTT will restore the BGP sessions to their original Administrative state.

Bogon ASN Filter Policy
The NTT Global IP Network will not accept route announcements from any eBGP neighbors which contain a Bogon ASN anywhere in the AS_PATH or its atomic aggregate attribute. Bogon ASNs are defined as 0, 23456, 64496 through 131071 and 4200000000 through 4294967295.

NTT GIN BGP-4 NEXT_HOP Policy
The NTT Global IP Network deviates slightly from the RFC 4271 BGP-4 specification, specifically section 6.3 "UPDATE Message Error Handling", regarding the contents of the BGP NEXT_HOP attribute.

The NTT GIN network has stricter requirements for IP addresses in the BGP NEXT_HOP attribute than RFC 4271 mandates. RFC 4271 allows any IP address that is part of a common subnet between the sending and receiving BGP speaker as a semantically correct NEXT_HOP. However, NTT GIN strictly requires the advertised BGP NEXT_HOP be the sender's IP address that is used to establish the EBGP connection.

MEDs
The NTT Global IP Network accepts MEDs from its customers.

Graceful BGP Session Shutdown
To reduce the amount of traffic lost when BGP sessions are about to be shut down deliberately, e.g., for planned maintenance, the NTT Global IP Network supports receiving and honoring the Graceful Shutdown BGP community 65535:0 (also known as "GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN") on all EBGP sessions.

More information about Graceful BGP Session Shutdown is available in RFC 8326.

Blackhole service (and new Selective Blackhole service)
Customers may announce hosts tagged with 2914:666 for v4 and v6 peering. Any /32 or /128 host tagged with this community will be discarded as soon as it reaches our network. The /32 or /128 prefix must be one included in the customer's existing ingress BGP filter. By default, peers are not configured for the blackhole functionality. Please contact the NTT NOC @ noc@us.ntt.net for this feature.

As of the beginning of March, 2015, NTT Communications now offers Selective Blackholing. This provides the ability to limit the scope of the blackholing to certain geographic locations, allowing a more strategic application of the blackhole service.

Selective Blackhole communities
2914:661   	only blackhole inside the region the announcement originated
2914:663	only blackhole inside the country the announcement originated
2914:660	only blackhole outside the region the announcement originated
2914:664	only blackhole outside the country the announcement originated
